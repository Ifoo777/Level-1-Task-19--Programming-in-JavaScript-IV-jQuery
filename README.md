## Task

Follow these steps:

● Create a basic HTML file with the following basic elements:

○ The name of your restaurant as the main heading.

○ 3 subheadings: “Our Story”, “Our Food” and “Our People”

○ Each subheading needs a brief description in paragraph form to elaborate on these subheadings (the paragraphs can be short)

○ Each paragraph should be accompanied by a picture.

● Import the jQuery library into your HTML document.

● Create a jQuery command that will create an alert once the page has loaded.

● Create a jQuery command that will change the background once the page has loaded.

● Create a jQuery function which changes only a single paragraph’s styling.

● Create a jQuery function which fades out any object that is clicked on.

● Create a jQuery function which creates a drop-down menu with the use of an accordion animation style when each section is hovered over. The dropdown menu should give the options of “Breakfast”, “Lunch, “Dinner”, “Desserts” and “Drinks”.

● Create a jQuery function which contains a chained effect to slide all the elements of your page around repeatedly whilst changing the background.

● Create a jQuery function which fades a picture in and out over a period of 3 seconds each when the respective buttons are clicked.

● Create a jQuery function which can stop the animation of the above effect whilst in progress.
