            With expectations comes standards. The issue is, with a restaurant
            like ours, which is the only one of its kind in the world, who would
            you compare us to? We want to offer guests something out of the
            norm, an experience that takes them out of their comfort zone of
            what they have defined in their mind as a sit down dinner.

            We want to redefine the dining experience. A sit down eight course
            two hour long dinner is great, but wouldn’t it be fun if each course
            happened in a different room, and the room is actually related to
            the course, and the person serving you the food is actually dressed
            to match everything you are experiencing in that room? And wouldn’t
            it be even more fun and absurd to move to another room for an
            entirely new experience for the next course? We want our guests to
            let their guards down, expect the unexpected and roll with it. The
            goal is to keep them guessing, surprise surprise!
